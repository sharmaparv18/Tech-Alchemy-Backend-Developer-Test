TASK 1:
You are a developer who accidentally went back in time. You canâ€™t return back to your
timeline because your time machine needs to sort an array from 10 Gigabytes of unsorted
integer data. The problem in front of you is Machine during that time was not that
advanced. You find a device with 1 gig of ram and 240 Gigabytes of the hard drive.
-They are all integers like 10,5,98,32,22,87,5,6,9 etc.
-Same integer values can be repeatedly appearing in the file.
Create a function to read 10 gigabytes of data and sort it. (Pseudocode and logic will also work)


SOLUTION:

APPROACH 1:

1. Split the file into parts (buffers) that you can sort in-place
2. Then when all buffers are sorted take 2 (or more) at the time and merge them (merge sort) 
3. Until there's only 1 buffer remaining which will be the sorted file
